# Asymmetric Information and Adverse Selection

## A Question

- At some urban universities, many students and faculty eat at lunch trucks that are parked along the streets surrounding the campus. Before going there for lunch one day, you ask two people where you should eat. Neither individual you ask has ever been there. One says, “Just pick the one with the shortest line.” The other says, “Pick the one with the longest line.” Which advice should you follow? 

## Introduction

- Today we'll discuss the issue of Asymmetric Information in Economics
- So far, all the models and market structures that we discussed consider that information (eve when missing!) is equally shared among all agents.
  - Prices in Perfect Competition
  - Payoffs in Prisoner's dilemma, etc.


<!---
## Example

- Why do people accept working in dangerous jobs?
  - Higher wages to compensate risk?
- Evidence of wage differentials across industries
- However we do not see differences across firms in the same industry.
  - Prospective employees often do not know the injury rates at individual firms but may know the **average** injury rate over an entire industry.
-->

## Problems Due to Asymmetric Information

- **Hidden characteristic** is an attribute of a person or thing that is known to one party but not to others
  - Adverse selection
- **Hidden action** is an act by one party to a transaction that is known to one party but not to others
  - Moral Hazard
  
## Adverse selection
- Let's focus on the issue of adverse selection now.
- Opportunism characterized by an informed person’s benefitting from trading with a less-informed person who doesn’t know about an **unobserved characteristic** of the informed person.
- Examples?
  - People who buy life insurance policies are better informed about their own health than insurance companies are.
  - What else?


## An Example of Adverse Selection | “If he wants to *sell* that horse, do I really want to *buy* it?”

- Consider the market for used cars.

## The Market for Lemons
- There are two types of cars in the market: low-quality (L) and high-quality (H).
- Assume a large number of potential buyers
  - Willingness to pay: 
    - $4,000 (L) 
    - $8,000 (H)
- Assume 2000 sellers:
  - 1000 owners of L cars
    - *Reservation price*: $3,000
  - 1000 owners of H cars
    - *Reservation price*: $5,000

## Market Equilibrium with Symmetric Information
- Situation 1: Buyers and sellers have full information

```

- Equilibrium: 2,000 cars are sold (1,000 L and 1,000 H)
  - $P_L = 4,000$ and $P_H = 8,000$

## Market Equilibrium with Symmetric Information
- Situation 2: Buyers and sellers have limited information
- Assume **risk neutrality**.

## A Detour Into the Risk Neutrality Assumption

- Suppose you are given two options:
  - $100 with certainty
  - A lottery with 50% of chance of receiving $200 and 50% of chance of receiving $0.
    - Expected value is $(\$200 \times 0.5) + (\$0 \times 0.5) = \$100$
- Which one do you prefer?
  - **Risk averse**: Choose the $100
  - **Risk lover (taker)**: Choose the lottery
  - **Risk neutral**: Indifferent
  
## Back to the Equilibrium
- Assume **risk neutrality**.
- Then, buyers will be willing to pay *at most*:
  - $(\$4,000 \times 0.5) + (\$8,000 \times 0.5) = \$6,000$
- Sellers will be willing to accept *at least*
  - $(\$3,000 \times 0.5) + (\$5,000 \times 0.5) = \$4,000$

```

- Equilibrium: 2,000 cars are sold (1,000 H and 1,000 L)
  - $P_L = P_H = P = \$6,000$
- If buyers and sellers do not know the quality of the cars, all cars will be sold for the **same** price.


## Market Equilibrium with Asymmetric Information
- Now let's assume that sellers know the quality of their cars but buyers do not.
- In this example, expected willingness to pay is higher than willingness to accept in both markets.
  - $\$6,000 > WTA_H = \$5,000$ and  $\$6,000 > WTA_L = \$3,000$
- Equilibrium is the same as before:
  - 2,000 cars are sold (1,000 H and 1,000 L)
  - $P_L = P_H = P = \$6,000$
  
## Market Equilibrium with Asymmetric Information
- Now consider a more interesting case:
  - Same numbers as before but the *reservation price* of the high quality car owners is $7,000.
- What changes?
  - Only L car owners will be willing to sell!
  - Buyers will notice that H car owners will be driven out of the market
- Equilibrium: 
  - 1,000 cars are sold (0 H and 1,000 L)
  - $P_L = \$4,000$
- This equilibrium is **inefficient** because potential buyers value H cars more than current owners!

## George Akerlof

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
- This simple example is based on a paper published by George Akerlof in the Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE), in 1970.

- Before being accepted at QJE, Akerlof faced some rejections along the way:
  - AER and RESTUD "*did not publish papers on topics of such triviality.*"
  - JPE: "*if this paper was correct, economics would be different.*"

## Example
- The figure below shows the market for (used and new) cars in a given town. Suppose that there are 1,000 car owners (10% used and 90% new).

- What are price and equilibrium quantities with symmetric (full) information?
- What are price and equilibrium quantities with symmetric (incomplete) information?
- What are price and equilibrium quantities with asymmetric information?

## Example 2
- Now assume that there are 1,000 car owners (90% used and 10% new).

- What are price and equilibrium quantities with symmetric (full) information?
- What are price and equilibrium quantities with symmetric (incomplete) information?
- What are price and equilibrium quantities with asymmetric information?


## Reducing Adverse Selection 
- An uninformed person may engage in **screening** to determine information held by informed people (e.g. test-driving a car)
- Signaling: An informed party may engage in **signaling** to send information to a less-informed person (e.g. firm distributing favorable report on its product by an independent testing agency, warranty, etc.)

## Laws and Policies to Prevent Opportunism
- Disclosure laws
  - Governments can require informed parties to disclose relevant information
- Product liability laws 
  - laws prevent consumers from being stuck with nonfunctional or dangerous products
- Universal coverage: 
  - Eliminate adverse selection in health insurance markets by government provision of health care to everyone
  
## Labor Market Applications
<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'> 
- What kinds of asymmetric information problems plague labor markets?
  - Prospective employees may have less information than firms do about working conditions.
  - Firms may have less information about potential employees’ abilities than potential workers do.
- We'll see how signaling and screening can affect (positively or negatively) the welfare in labor markets.
  - Let's assume that there are two types of workers in the market: H and L
  - Firms are not able to distinguish between them
</div>

<div class='right' style='float:right;width:48%'>
  ![](/Users/henriquefonseca/Desktop/temp/Rmarkdown-practice/econ253/pam_quality_workers.jpeg)
</div>

## Signaling

- What types of signals can the workers send to their prospective employers to reveal their types?
  - Add skills on C.V.
  - Get a degree
- We'll next briefly discuss both strategies.

## Cheap Talk

- Suppose that Cindy is in a job interview for one position in a firm.
- She might be offered (or not) either a demanding or an undemanding job 
- Cindy and the firm have the same goal: be assigned to the job according to her ability. 
- The game below depicts this story:

  - ![ ](/Users/henriquefonseca/Desktop/temp/Rmarkdown-practice/econ253/cheap_talk_work.png){width=60%}
  
## Cheap Talk

- Now assume that Cindy wants a demanding job regardless of her ability (maybe because it gives her higher status?).
- In this case, Cindy's and firm's goals are not aligned and cheap talk does not provide a credible signal.
- The game below shows this situation.
  - ![ ](/Users/henriquefonseca/Desktop/temp/Rmarkdown-practice/econ253/cheap_talk_not_work.png){width=60%}
- The firm knowing her incentives, evaluates their potential expected payoffs:
  - $(0.5\times 2)+(0.5\times 1)=1.5$ if gives her the demanding job
  - $(0.5\times 4)+(0.5\times 1)=2.5$ if gives her the undemanding job
- If Cindy is H, this outcome might be **inefficient** because she might be better off with the demanding job.

## Education as a Signal
- Whenever cheap talk does not work, workers might need to send a more costly signal.
- Education might serve as a signal to potential employers if H workers have a lower cost of obtaining a degree.
- Assumptions of the Signaling Model:
  - Schooling provides no useful training and only serves as a signal (don't worry, this is an unrealistic assumption - I hope!!).
  - H workers are $\theta$ share of the workforce; L workers are $1-\theta$ share.
  - H workers are worth $w_h$ to the firm; L workers are worth $w_l$ and will pay workers these marginal products.

  
## Education as a Signal
- Without education, firms offer a single wage to all workers based on the expected product
  - $\bar{w}=\theta w_h+(1-\theta)w_l$

- If $w_h - c > \bar{w}$, it is advantageous to H workers to pay the cost of education and signal their ability.
- Then, in equilibrium:
  - H workers payoff is $w_h - c$
  - L workers payoff is $w_l$.
  - Firms break even because they pay the worker's marginal product
- Skip the textbook's treatment (as well as Sections 18.3 and 18.4)

## Screening in Hiring
- Firms screen prospective workers in various ways:
  - Based on **observable** characteristics believed to be correlated with ability
    - Examples?
  - Based on performance on a test, which may or may not accurately measure skills required on the job.
  
## Statistical Discrimination
- Some employers engage in *statistical discrimination*. 
  - Hiring based on the belief that people of a certain age, gender, race, religion, or ethnicity have a higher ability than others on average.
- Statistical discrimination is "efficient", from a purely economic standpoint, but it is often unlawful, not to mention unethical.
  - In the U.S., it is illegal in to make hiring, pay, or promotion decisions using a performance prediction that is based on race, sex, age or disability.
- Statistical discrimination is difficult to detect, however, and so it is plausible that it occurs frequently despite the law.

## Empirical Evidence for Discrimination in the Labor Market
<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
- In order to answer the question of whether there is racial labor
market discrimination, Bertrand and Mullainathan elaborate an interesting
experiment:
- Sending resumes by mail or fax to advertised job positions while
manipulating perceptions of race by using distinctively ethnic
names (otherwise holding constant resume characteristics)
- The authors find that callback rates are lower for black sounding names.

</div>

## Moral Hazard

- Opportunism characterized by an informed person’s taking advantage of a less-informed person through an **unobserved action**.
- Examples?
  - Taxi driver overcharge customers by taking the longest route
  - What else?

## Moral Hazard
<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
- Chapter 19 of the textbook is about this.
- Focus on different types of contracts and moral hazard under different situations.
  - Provides a formal treatment of the problem.
- Let's disregard that and treat the issue in a more relaxed way.

## Principal-Agent Problem
- In a principal-agent relationship a *principal*, such as an employer, contracts with an *agent*, such as an employee, to take some action that benefits the principal.
  - Example: You pay someone by the hour to prepare your tax return, but don’t know whether they worked all the hours that were billed.
    - Principal: you
    - Agent: accountant 

## Financing a project

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
- Lenders face the risk that money borrowed will not be repaid, but lack information about the project’s success or borrower’s effort so cannot ensure that the project succeeds. 
- To resolve the conflict of interest between the principal (lender) and the agent (borrower):
  - Equity: the lender may require the borrower to put some of her wealth into the project
  - Collateral: the borrower has to set aside property that will be transferred to the lender if the loan is not repaid
</div>

<div class='right' style='float:left;width:48%'>
![](/Users/henriquefonseca/Desktop/temp/Rmarkdown-practice/econ253/yesman.png){width=90%}
</div>

## Credit Rationing

- Those with less wealth find it more difficult to provide equity or collateral. 
  - Credit constrained: borrow on unfavorable terms compared with those with more wealth 
  - Credit-excluded: are refused loans entirely 

## Redlining

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
- Ratings system to evaluate risks associated with loans to specific neighborhoods.
- Used by:
  - Home Owners Loan Corporation
  - Federal Housing Administration
  - Many private banks and companies used these maps to make their own lending and investment decisions
